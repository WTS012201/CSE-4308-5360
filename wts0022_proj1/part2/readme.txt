Python was used for this task. I don't believe that it is omega compatible.

Code is structured as follows: 
- In MaxConnect4Game.py
- I used the provided code from the assignment page. Everything that is in there is at the top
- Everything I added or modified is towards the bottom (starts at line 277).

- In maxconnect4.py
- Interactive mode
- oneMoveGame mode
- Part that gets file input that was provided

To run, do
    python maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]
or
    python maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]
